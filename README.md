Why I Built This?
Because AI shouldn't only think — it should also feel.

This project is a personal exploration of how machines can interpret emotional cues and become more intuitive in human interaction. It merges my background in engineering with my interest in psychology and affective computing.
Let's make AI a bit more human.
